Building web services should be simple. Atmo makes it easy to create a powerful server application without needing to worry about scalability, infrastructure, or complex networking.

Atmo enables you to write small self-contained functions called **Runnables** using a variety of languages, and define your business logic by **declaratively composing** them. Atmo then automatically scales out a **flat network** of instances to handle traffic. Atmo is currently focused on building web services, particularly APIs, and can be used with a variety of architectures including HTTP- and stream-based environments.

## Get started

**✨ To start building with Atmo, visit the [Atmo guide](https://atmo.suborbital.dev) ✨**

Atmo uses a declarative file called the [Directive](https://atmo.suborbital.dev/concepts/the-directive) where you describe your application's behaviour. Because the Directive can describe everything you need to make your application work (including routes, logic, and more), there is no need to write boilerplate ever again.

With Atmo, you only need to do three things:
1. Write self-contained, composable functions
2. Declare how you want Atmo to handle requests by creating a "Directive"
3. Build and deploy your Runnable bundle

Atmo is a server-side runtime and application framework. It uses a **bundle** containing your Runnables and Directive to automatically run your application.

## Background

Atmo is designed to embody the [SUFA design pattern](https://blog.suborbital.dev/building-a-better-monolith) (Simple, Unified, Function-based Applications). This means you can build your project into a single deployable unit, and Atmo will take care of the server, scaling out its job scheduler, and meshing together auto-scaled instances.
